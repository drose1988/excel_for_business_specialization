##### Introduction

- point of the course is to help fill the gaps, understand how Excel works

- confidently work efficiently, enter data, delete, and edit data

- different data types behave slightly differently 

- understanding the fill handle

##### Taking charge of Excel

- ribbon contains most tools we need

- tools in the ribbon are logically grouped

- collapsing the ribbon

- tools not included in the dropdown can be added to quick access toolbar by right clicking

- status bar at the bottom right gives you the average, count, sum of values you've selected

- click anywhere in the dataset and select all rows and columns in the dataset :: cmd-a

- ##### Navigating and Selecting

- move up/down one screen :: fn-up arrow / fn-down arrow

- move one screen to the left/right :: fn-option- up arrow

- to move to the first cell in spreadsheet :: fn-cnt-left arrow

- selecting non-contiguous data :: cntr-opt

##### View Options

- status bar on the bottom right corner

- zoomer slider

- 3 view options

- these tools are accessible in the view ribbon

- split tool in the view ribbon, you can double click on the split to remove it

- freeze panes to control the heading and whichever cell you want to split your data

- switch windows in the view ribbon to navigate between workbooks

- shortcut to switch windows :: cmd-~

##### Data Entry, Data Types, Editing and Deleting

- tab and enter when you're entering data is useful when entering mutliple columns worth of data down rows

- delete on the home ribbon will delete the cell rather than the cell value

- while changing the value in a cell, you can just press esc to revert back to original value before committing the change

- bad idea to leave blank space within your columns

- autosum tool in the home ribon is a quick option to sum values

##### Fill Handle

- fill handle allows us to quickly copy

- when you have a combination of text and numbers it automatically adds one to number

- fill handles create a series

- you can select mutliple columns and fill handle down and it will fill in each column 

- with numbers you automatically get a copy of the value

- you have the option to change your fill into series, copy cells, fill formatting, flash fill

- for dates you can adjust the fill by year, month, day

- flash fill is a more sophisticated fill option

- edit -> fill -> flash fill

##### Copy and Paste

- copying to the clipboard has many applications

- clipboard allows us to change our paste options at the time we paste

- paste values

- using cut and paste will not make a copy of your data you paste, it will move the original data 

- transpose from the paste options allows us to swing our data 90 degrees

- copying and pasting from another appliction to Excel or vice versa
